Hello Spark and Hadoop!
This is a test file for HDFS and Spark integration.
Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
Apache Hadoop provides reliable, scalable, distributed computing.
HDFS stores data across multiple machines.
Spark can read data from HDFS very efficiently.
Let's test if everything works correctly!
Big Data processing is powerful with Spark and Hadoop.
This line contains the word Spark again.
And this line mentions Hadoop one more time.
Testing testing 123.
MapReduce was the old way.
Now Spark is the new standard.
Real-time analytics with Spark Streaming.
Machine learning with Spark MLlib.
Graph processing with Spark GraphX.
SQL queries with Spark SQL.
Data science is easier with these tools.
Scale horizontally by adding more nodes.
Fault tolerance is built into the system.
